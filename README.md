# 🧑‍💻 Portfolio Project

Hello! This is my personal portfolio project, rebuilt using **ReactJS** and **NextJS**. It’s a refreshed version of my previous portfolio, which was originally created with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Instead of modifying or discarding my old project, I chose to create a brand-new one while keeping the original as part of my portfolio. The legacy version still serves as a demonstration of my **fundamental programming skills**, showcasing my grasp of core web development concepts.

I firmly believe that **strong fundamentals are the foundation of any skill**, and this dual approach allows me to highlight both my mastery of modern frameworks and my capability to work with the essentials.
