# Portfolio Project

Hello! This is my personal portfolio project, rebuilt using **ReactJS** and **NextJS**. It is a refreshed version of my previous portfolio, which was originally built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Instead of modifying or discarding my old project, I chose to create a brand-new one while keeping the original as part of my portfolio. The older version still serves as a demonstration of my **fundamental programming skills**, showcasing my mastery of core web development concepts.

I firmly believe that **strong fundamentals are the foundation of any skill**, and this dual approach allows me to highlight both my grasp of modern frameworks and my capability to work with the essentials.

## Key Features

- üöÄ **Modern Frameworks**: Leveraging ReactJS and NextJS for a seamless, performant, and scalable portfolio.
- üé® **Custom Design**: Personalized styling for a unique and professional look.
- ‚ö° **Optimized Performance**: Fast load times and responsive design.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Legacy Integration**: My previous portfolio, built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, remains accessible to showcase my foundational skills.

## Why This Approach?

By maintaining the old project, I can present a clear progression in my skill set:

- **Fundamentals First**: The older portfolio showcases a solid understanding of core web technologies.
- **Modern Proficiency**: The new portfolio demonstrates expertise in ReactJS and NextJS, including modern development practices.
